        Climate change basically means the climate is getting warmer, which is global warming. Climate change also means a change in long-term weather patterns.<sup><a href="#citations-2">[2, page 46]</a></sup> Global warming has been demonstrated by Eunice Newton Foote in 1856, showing that the effect of the sun is higher for water vapour in air than with dry air. Svante Arrhenius has noted that the water vapour in the air varied continuously. Foote said in conclusion, "A atmosphere with gas would give Earth a higher tempature."<sup><a href="#citations-4">[4]</a></sup>

        Some facts about climate change is that the Earth's temperature has gone up by 0.08 degrees every decade since 1880, meaning that the Earth is getting warmer.<sup><a href="#citations-1">[1]</a></sup> Because of this, heat waves and wildfires would be more common, making it hotter.<sup><a href="#citations-4">[4]</a></sup> As a part of climate change, the Earth's average tempature is getting higher, and also changing what foods can be grown in certain areas.<sup><a href="#citations-3">[3, page 58]</a></sup> For example, farmers on the Canadian Praries used to not be able to grow corn there, because the climate wasn't warm enough to grow corn. Now, the climate on the Canadian Praries is warm enough to grow corn.

        Climate change can affect many aspects of our life, like the clothes we wear. For example, people living in a cold climate would wear warm clothes, and people living in a warm climate would wear light clothes.<sup><a href="#citations-2">[2, page 46]</a></sup> Another example is that climate change will increace the chances of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.<sup><a href="#citations-2">[2, page 48]</a></sup> The climate can also affect what we consume by limiting the food that can be grown in an area.<sup><a href="#citations-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#citations-4">[4]</a></sup> For example, some foods can only grow in a certain climate, such as, pineapples only grow in tropical areas.

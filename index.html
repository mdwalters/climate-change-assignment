                You might think about climate change every now and then, but it is a very serious problem that is going on right now.

                Now, if you don't know what climate change is, it basically means the climate is getting warmer, which is global warming. This is because of greenhouse gasses. It also means a change in long-term weather patterns.<sup><a href="#citations-2">[2, page 46]</a></sup>

            <span>
                Some facts about climate change is that the Earth's temperature has gone up by 0.08 degrees every decade since 1880.<sup><a href="#citations-1">[1]</a></sup> That means that the Earth is getting warmer! The climate can affect what we consume by limiting the food that can be grown.<sup><a href="#citations-2">[2, page 46]</a></sup> For example, some foods can only grow in a certain climate, such as, pineapples only grow in tropical areas.
